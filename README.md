##About Stack and Experience

REACT JS is chosen by me. I had little knowledge about this library as I had only done designing part in my previous project. In this project I have learnt different functionalities of form, addition and deletion from array of objects.

##URL Shortner

This is a web application that shortens long URL by generating short URL.

##Features

- Accepts a long URL from the user and generates a shortened URL

-Short URL indicated with the 'Short URL Code' on the form and it is listed at the bottom of the list in the 'Available Links'

-When the short link is clicked, it redirects the user to the original long link. Additionally, the count value associated with the short URL is incremented by one, indicating the number of times the short URL has been visited. This count value is then stored in a persistent memory along with the corresponding long and short URLs

-There is also an 'Statistics' page for showing all the URLs and their counts showing the number of times the short links have been visited
   
-Individual number of count for a certain link can be seen by routing to domain/shorURLcode/stat
